**Project Description**

A single web page that features an image slider, newsletter signup form, and a navigation menu which navigates to multiple sections within the page via smooth scroll.

**Tools & Methods Used**

The following were used to build this page:

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)/JavaScript
- [bxSlider](http://bxslider.com/) plugin
- [Smooth scroll](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717527/jquery-smooth-scrolling-when-clicking-an-anchor-link) code snippet

**Little Things I Learned**

- use case for using _vw_ units in bxSlider section
- handy CSS trick to keep the aspect ratio of the images in the product category section
- the combined use of _position: relative_ and _position: absolute_ to place a submit button within an input field
- use of helper classes to make a web page screen reader friendly and search engine optimized

**Project Epilogue**

A two-week project where we took the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lessons to construct this web page.

In week one, we learned basic HTML and CSS structure which was then used to build most of the web page. The use of the _float_ property and the need to clear floats took some time to fully understand.

In week two, we built upon what we had learned in addition to learning _Flexbox_, _JavaScript_, and _jQuery_. The original float-based layout was replaced in favour of a Flexbox layout, which also took some time to learn and get used to but is more intuitive than using floats. The addition of jQuery/JavaScript to make the page respond to user interaction was very intriguing. Learning how to navigate the DOM to target the correct elements required some trial and error but was very satisfying to figure out.

Overall, it's mind-blowing to know that the amount we learned in two weeks is enough to make a beautiful looking webpage.
